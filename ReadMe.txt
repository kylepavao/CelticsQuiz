First Project for Android Development
Based upon the GeoQuiz project found in "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" by Ben Phillips and Brian Hardy

When the application is run the user is brought to a panel with a true/false question and 5 buttons. The user
can guess the answer by pressing the "true" or "false" buttons. If the user guesses correctly, the user is sent a congratulatory
message. The user also has the option to skip to the next or previous question by pressing the "next" or "previous" buttons. If at
any time the user wants to cheat and have the answer revealed to them without guessing they can press the "cheat" button and
get brought to the cheat panel where they are asked whether or not they are sure they want to cheat. By confirming, the user is sent
a message containing the answer. After the user presses the given answer, they are sent a message acknowledging their dishonesty.
